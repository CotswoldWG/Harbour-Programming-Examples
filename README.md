# Harbour-Programming-Examples
This setup only requires the executable and the tables in the same folder. If you do not have the 
indexes, when you open the Tickets or Customers, they will be created. You can also create them from 
the menu item UTILITIES, Backup & Reindex. 

It is intended to assist someone new to Harbour so they can see a basic system from which they can 
progress from. For a new starter to get to the same position would probably take several weeks. 
Nonetheless, a new user will need to have spent some time understanding Harbour and the compile 
process. Or just enough to get this to compile!

NOTE! I use a three letter prefix to all of my systems and usually what it should be is obvious. In this 
case there could be so many possibilities. So in the end I settled for HBR.
